We love hearing your ideas for new features! To request a feature, please follow the steps below:

1. **Open an Issue**  
   Visit our [Feature Requests](https://github.com/digreatbrian/duck/issues) page and open a new issue using the "Feature Request" template. Clearly describe what you'd like to see added and why it would be helpful.

2. **Be Clear and Specific**  
   Include any relevant use cases, examples, or mockups that might help us better understand the request.

3. **Check for Duplicates**  
   Before submitting, please search to see if a similar feature has already been requested. If it has, consider adding a comment or 👍 reaction instead.
