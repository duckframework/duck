name: Build & Deploy Sphinx Multiversion Docs

# IMPORTANT: This workflow must trigger on BOTH branches AND tags
# - Branch triggers (main): Updates docs for the latest development version
# - Tag triggers (*): Builds docs when new versions are released  
# - sphinx-multiversion uses git history to build docs for all versions together
# - fetch-depth: 0 is required to access full git history for multiversion builds
