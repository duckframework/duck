Duck provides **robust session management** using `SessionMiddleware`.  
This middleware is responsible for **loading, saving, and managing sessions** in a flexible way.

---

## Session Storage Options

Duck supports multiple session storage backends:

- **In-memory cache:** `duck.utils.caching.InMemoryCache` — fast but temporary.  
- **Key-as-folder cache:** `duck.utils.caching.KeyAsFolderCache` — stores sessions in filesystem folders.  
- **Dynamic file cache:** `duck.utils.caching.DynamicFileCache` — flexible file-based storage.  

> You can also implement a **custom cache class**, but it must provide: `set`, `get`, `delete`, `clear`, and `save` methods.

---

## Accessing Sessions

- Access the request session via `request.SESSION` or `request.session`.  
- Sessions are **lazily saved**, meaning they are written only if there are changes.  
- To change session storage, set `SESSION_STORAGE` in `settings.py`.  

### Example:

```py
# views.py
from duck.http.response import HttpResponse

def some_view(request):
    request.SESSION["some_key"] = some_value # Or use request.session
    return HttpResponse("Hello world")
```

**Notes:**
- Request sessions are lazily saved if changes are detected.

 
```{warning}
It is generally not recommended to explicitly save a session. Doing so can prevent the `SessionMiddleware` from accurately detecting whether the session data has changed, which is how it determines whether updated session cookies need to be sent to the client.  

Instead, allow the middleware to manage session persistence automatically. If you explicitly save the session, you may need to manually mark the session as modified by setting `request.SESSION.modified = True`. This ensures that `request.SESSION.needs_update()` returns `True`, allowing the middleware to issue any required cookie updates.
```

## Session Settings

Most defaults are safe, but you can customize as needed:

### Session Engine

The engine handling session operations.

- Avoid overriding unless necessary.  
- For Django integration (`USE_DJANGO=True`), you must implement a custom Django session backend.

### Session Directory

Directory where session files are stored (if using file-based storage).

- Database-backed sessions: set to `None`.  
- Directory will be auto-created if it doesn’t exist.

### Session Cookie Name

Name of the cookie storing the session ID.  
- Default: `session_id`

### Session Duration

Lifetime of the session in seconds.  
- Default: 7 days (`604800` seconds)

### Session Cookie Path

Path attribute for session cookie.  
- Default: `'/'`

### Session Cookie Domain

Domain attribute for session cookie.  
- Default: `None` → resolves to Duck app domain

### Session Expire at Browser Close

Whether the session expires when the browser is closed.  
- Default: `False`

### Session Cookie Secure

Restricts cookie to HTTPS.  
- Default: `False`

### Session Cookie HttpOnly

Restricts access via JavaScript.  
- Default: `True`

### Session Cookie SameSite

Controls cross-site request behavior.  
- Default: `"Lax"`

## Notes & Tips

- Duck sessions are **lightweight and flexible** for both short and long-lasting sessions.  
- Always pick a session backend that fits your **performance and persistence needs**.  
- Combine with Duck’s **middleware and async features** for secure, scalable web apps.
