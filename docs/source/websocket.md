Duck makes **WebSocket implementation** simple and powerful 🔌.  
Forget the boilerplate — with Duck you can add real-time features in just a few lines of code 🚀.  

---

## Quick Example

In your **`urls.py`**, define a WebSocket view:

```py
# urls.py

from duck.urls import path
from duck.contrib.websockets import WebSocketView, OpCode

class MyWebSocket(WebSocketView):
    async def on_open(self):
        print("WebSocket connection established")
        
    async def on_receive(self, data: bytes, opcode: int):
        if opcode == OpCode.TEXT:
            message = "You sent " + data.decode("utf-8")
            await self.send_text(message)
        else:
            # Handle binary frames here
            pass

# Register your WebSocket route
urlpatterns = [
    path("/ws/myws", MyWebSocket, name="mywebsocket"),
    # other patterns here.
]
```

✅ That’s it! Your app is now ready to handle **WebSocket connections**.  

---

## Customizing Behavior

Duck’s WebSocket views support configurable class variables:

- ⏱ **`RECEIVE_TIMEOUT`** → default: `120` seconds  
  (timeout before expecting a new frame).  
- 📦 **`MAX_FRAME_SIZE`** → default: `1 * 1024 * 1024` bytes  
  (maximum allowed size of a frame).  

Simply override these in your `WebSocketView` subclass to tweak performance.

## Practical Examples

### Simple Chat App

A minimal chat implementation that **echoes messages** back to all connected users.

```py
from duck.contrib.websockets import WebSocketView, OpCode

connected_clients = set()
ids = 0

class ChatSocket(WebSocketView):
    user_id = 0
    async def on_open(self):
        connected_clients.add(self)
        self.user_id = ids
        ids += 1
        await self.send_text("👋 Welcome to the chat!")

    async def on_receive(self, data: bytes, opcode: int):
        if opcode == OpCode.TEXT:
            message = data.decode("utf-8")
            
            # Broadcast to all connected clients
            for client in connected_clients:
                if client != self:
                    await client.send_text(f"User {client.user_id}: {message}")

    async def on_close(self):
        connected_clients.remove(self)
```

---

### Live Notifications

Send **server-initiated notifications** to clients:

```py
import asyncio
from duck.contrib.websockets import WebSocketView
from duck.utils.asyncio import create_task # Better than default asyncio.create_task

class NotificationSocket(WebSocketView):
    async def on_open(self):
        # Push notifications every 5 seconds
        create_task(self.push_notifications())

    async def push_notifications(self):
        count = 0
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(5)
            count += 1
            await self.send_text(f"🔔 Notification #{count}")
```
